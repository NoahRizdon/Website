        <hr><br><p>8/31/23 <br> This is the start of my website. This week, I learned about rube goldberg simple machines. I know of one that I use daily which is a ramp since I bike to school every day. I also enjoyed working with tinkercad to help design my rube goldberg project. I'm excited to work on the real thing later with my group.</p>

<h>Week 2</h>
        <p>
            8/24/23 <br> The things I learned this week are that teamwork is required to do some things. Another thing I learned this week are all the different types of engineering that fall under the category of mechanical engineering. The engineering that seems the most interesting to me was automotive engineering. I would like to be a car designer in the future. Aerospace engineering comes in a close second.<br>

        <br> <h>Week 3</h>
        <p>9/7/23 <br>This week I've had lots of tests. I have another test tommorrow as well. The test I took today was about mechanical engineering and it was hard because I couldn't remember anything as soon as I started the test so It was bad. I was one of the last ones so what i've learned is that you should stay focused and study alot. <br>

        <br> <h>Week 4</h>
        <p>9/14/23 <br> .I  worked on the rube goldberg project with my group  which was super fun to work on with my teammates. The cardboard was hard to work with sometimes. And the We solved many problems and challenges along the way.

        <h>Week 5</h>
        <p>8/21/23<br> This week, we made floating devices out of paper. It was annoying because some girl knocked my boat over when she took it out and it sank. It would have lasted the full five minutes if she hadnt done that and I would have won. We also learned about the parts of a computer. I'm kind of into computers so it was fun. We also learned about the falkon robotics club. I was going to go yesterday but I got sick.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>9/28/23<br> This week, we learned all about the components of a computer. We were able to take an actual computer apart and look at the parts. We first had to take the computer apart and then we looked at each of the peieces. My personal favorite was the Metal Beast or the heat sink. The hard part was putting all the parts back together and putting all the wires back in the same place they were meant to be.

        <h>Week 6<h/>
        <p>10/5/23 <br> This week, we learned about aerospace engineering, and bio engineering. Daron and I had tons of fun making Frannie's Hand 2.0. Which was the cardboard hand that picked up the water bottle. I didn't go on thursday however, I got to go to Vegas and see a U2 concert in the Dome, which was sick. But I did miss half of the week so I have tons of make-up work to do.

        <h.>Week 7</h><br>
        ,h<p>10/4/23<br>This week we learned more about bioengineering. We learned about biomicricy the gecko robot that can climb walls. We also started talking about a bottle rocket I think. The bottle rocket project seems like it will be super fun. I also had to take a quiz which ,I hope I did good on. <br> <br> <img src= "A.jpeg" width="300" height=""></p>
        <h>Week 8</h><br>
        <p>10/12/23 This week we learned about aero engineering. We also started designing our bottle rockets on tinkercad. I thknk my design will go super far. I'm planning on having 16 wings on the bottle rocket, to make sure that it will go straight. But it might look a little ridiculous with 16 whole wings on just one two liter bottle. <img src="forces.png"></p>
        <br>
        <h>Week 9</h><br>
        <p>10/19/23 this week we started production and finished/launched the bottle rockets. Instead of going with my original design of 16 wings, Evan and I decided to lower it to 8. we were going to do 10 but we needed a pencil so it would launch straight, so we had to make things even and we couldnt actually put 10 on since we had to make things even on both sides. Anyways, our design didnt actually work, pretty much no ones did, we tested it befor eand it was pretty aerodynamic. But there were too many factors effecting ther launch of our rocket which made it just do spins and eventually crash into the ground. We did get second place so that was nice. </p>
        <h>Week 10</h><br>
        <p>10/30/23 This week we learned about water filtration and treatment. We learned about the different types of water and how they are recycled into usable water. We also created pretty primitive water filtration systems. We could only use sand, rocks, pebbles, and cotton balls. Our order from top to bottom was: Rock, Pebbles, Sand, Then cotton balls. Our thinking was that the rocks and pebbles would catch the bigger stuff, and the sand and cotton balls would catch the little parts of dirt and other moclecules.

        <h>Week 11</h> <br>
        <p>11/3/23 <br> This week we learned about Electrical Engineering. We learned about the units of electricity, volts, amps, ohms, and watts. Something else we learned about electircal engineering is resisters. Resisters are little things you put on a breadboard (the board that holds everything) which reduces the amount of voltage going through. I like using the breadboards its fun and its satisfying to get it right, im excited to workk with real breadboards and circuits. <img src="FWANNIE.png" height="300" width="450"></p>
<h>Week 12</h><br>
<p>11/13/23 <br>This week we learned about building circuits. We learned about breadboards and how the electric currents run through them too. We worked with circuits on tinkercad & in real life with phycisical circuits. We used wires, resisters, and LEDs to create a circuit. We also learned about how to measure voltage and ohms with a multimeter. It takes two people to do easily though, and it also takes really steady hands. <img src="breadboardingstuff.png"> </p>    

<h>Week 13</h><br>
<p>21/23/30 This week we learned about business engineering. I think it would be fun to be a business engineer because I like designing things. I also really like doing business with people I think its fun. We also started a shark tank project. For now, our product is going to be gloves that you wear when you are biking and you press a button and the have lights so you can signal when you are changing lanes. <img src="gloves.webp" height="200" width="200" </p>
<br><h>Week 14</h><br>
<p>This week, we finished up our shark tank pitch. We changed the idea from gloves to a website that helps you with college. You put in info about what you want your major to be and what colleges you want to go to and the app will not just recommend a college but tell you what you should do to get into it. Were only charging 40,000 dollars for a whlle 15% of our company i think we should charge like 100,000 for like 5%. Also we only sell the app for 1$ I think we need to sell it for 5$.</p>
