        <p>9/7/23 This week I've had lots of tests. I have one tommorrow. The test I took today was about mechanical engineering and it was hard because I couldn't remember anything as soon as I started the test so It was bad. I was one of the last ones so what i've learned is that you should stay focused and study alot. </p>
