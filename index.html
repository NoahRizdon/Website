        <hr><br><p>8/31/23 <br> This is the start of my website. This week, I learned about rube goldberg simple machines. I know of one that I use daily which is a ramp since I bike to school every day. I also enjoyed working with tinkercad to help design my rube goldberg project. I'm excited to work on the real thing later.</p>

            8/24/23 <br> The things I learned this week are that teamwork is required to do some things. Another thing I learned this week are all the different types of engineering that fall under the category of mechanical engineering. The engineering that seems the most interesting to me was automotive engineering. I would like to be a car designer in the future. Aerospace engineering comes in a close second.<br>

        <p>9/7/23 <br>This week I've had lots of tests. I have another test tommorrow as well. The test I took today was about mechanical engineering and it was hard because I couldn't remember anything as soon as I started the test so It was bad. I was one of the last ones so what i've learned is that you should stay focused and study alot. <br>

        <p>9/14/23 <br> . I also worked on the rube goldberg project which was super fun to work on with my teammates. The cardboard was hard to work with sometimes. And the We solved many problems and challenges along the way.

        <h>Week 5</h>
        <p>8/21/23<br> This week, we made floating devices out of paper. It was annoying because some girl knocked my boat over when she took it out and it sank. It would have lasted the full five minutes if she hadnt done that and I would have won. We also learned about the parts of a computer. I'm kind of into computers so it was fun. We also learned about the falkon robotics club. I was going to go yesterday but I got sick.
